 Wolbachia
==========

 Context 
--------
##### What is it?
`Wolbachia`, or more specifically `Wolbachia Pipientis`, is a bacteria that infects arthropod species. `Wolbachia` are considered mutualistic endosymbionts, and are "required for survival of their hosts."[4] An interesting thing to note is how universal `Wolbachia`seems to be. It has been demonstrated that `Wolbachia` infects 25-70% of species of insects.[7] 


##### How does it function?
`Wolbachia` are found in the ovaries and testes of a wide range of arthropods.[8] 


##### When/How was it discovered?
Wolbachia was first discovered by Samuel Burt Wolbach and described by Marshall Hertig. Wolbach had been studying the cause of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and by 1916 had shown that `Dermacentor andersoni`, a tick native to the Rocky Mountain area, was the transmitter of the disease.[1] He was unable to grow the actual bacteria causing the disease, a species of `Rickettsia`, in a cell-free culture leading "him to speculate as to the relationship between the cells of the host and the intracellular parasites."[2] This is important to note, because the discovery of Wolbachia is closely linked to this idea.

Hertig came to work with Wolbach, and together they investigated a bacteria living in the gonads of the `C. pipiens` mosquito. This bacteria is known today as `Wolbachia pipientis` which Hertig gave a detailed description of in 1936.[3] At this point scientists did not know of the gene manipulation that `Wolbachia` has on it's hosts, and the discovery largely went unnoticed. 

In the 1960s and '70s, scientists noted "unusual structures in the oocytes or in the hypodermis" of filarial nematodes but did not associate them with bacteria.[5] It wasn't until 1995 that these "unusual structures" were determined to be `Wolbachia`.[6]

The history of Wolbachia is filled with stories of discovery and re-discovery, as people gained more and more interest in this bizarre creature.


##### Key/Unusual Features?
One of the most unique features of `Wolbachia` is the reproductive changes it makes in it's host species. It can cause cytoplasmic incompatibility [9, 10, 11, 12], parthenogenesis [13], feminization of males [14] and male killing.[15]

+ Large genetic diversity amongst different strains (see p16-17)A
+ Vertical vs. Horizontal Transfer

+ Fucking bizarre relationship with it's host

##### State of Scientific understanding when discovered


 Impact
-------
##### How did it change the world?
 ( Scientific & Historical Narrative )
+ Weird Evolutionary relationship with it's host (see p15)
  + Can evolve in and out of it's host
  + Messes with the sexual being of it's host

+ Targeting Wolbachia with anti-bacterial can cure filarial infections
  + Infecting insects with Wolbachia causes them to not carry Dengue Fever
